GVis is a tiny simplification layer for the Google Visualisation API which makes life a lot easier.

GVis is very easy to use, just have a quick look in the demos/ directory. It takes no more than 3 lines
of JavaScript to get something up and running!

demos/ 
 * index.html let's you play around with different map types and outputs the source code
 * demo1.html is a simple demo of nothing more but the bare minimum for a pie chart
 * demo2.html same, but for an intensity map
 * demo3.html same, but for a geo map
